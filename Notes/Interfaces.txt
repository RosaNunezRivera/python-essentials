Interfaces (abstract classes)

	At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. Like
	classes, interfaces define methods. Unlike classes, these methods are
	abstract. An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. It
	doesn’t implement the methods. This is done by classes, which then implement
	the interface and give concrete meaning to the interface’s abstract methods
