  Mutable vs immutable
    Everything in Python is an object. And what every newcomer to Python should
    quickly learn is that all objects in Python can be either mutable or
    immutable. Immutable objects doesn’t allow modification after creation

    Mutable and immutable objects are handled differently in Python. Immutable
    objects are quicker to access and are expensive to change because it
    involves the creation of a copy

    Numbers (int, float, and complex), strings, tuples, and booleans are
    immutable, which means their contents can't be altered after creation

    We can use the built-in functions id() and type() to compare objects


  Docstrings
    Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of
    associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and
    methods

    It’s specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a
    specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the
    docstring should describe what the function does, not how
