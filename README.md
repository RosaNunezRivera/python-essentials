## Python in action

This introductory course covers the fundamentals of Python programming, from
data types to exceptions. The topics are developed through simple and easy to
understand examples.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is notorious
for having a very simple "pseudocode-like" syntax that places emphasis on
readability and expressiveness. This not only makes code simpler to write but
also easier to maintain. Additionally, it features a vast standard library that
is augmented by an even larger array of third-party libraries. These are all
developed and supported by Python's very active community.

Development is also faster in Python, as it is an interpreted language. This
means that the instructions are interpreted at runtime and there's no need to
pre-compile the program into machine language instructions. This makes for
quick prototyping and experimentation. Python's interpreted nature, along with
its dynamic typing system, are what really set it apart from languages such as
Java or C++.

Python also supports multiple paradigms, such as the following:

- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming
- Imperative programming
- Procedural programming
